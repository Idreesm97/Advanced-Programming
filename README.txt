OBJECTIVE:

	>A.The objective of this ACW is to implement, exercise and assess the performance of data structures that
	represent a transport network and support route-finding and evaluation. A network is a collection of nodes
	and arcs so, in the context of a transport network the nodes will correspond to road/rail junctions;
	towns/cities/villages; bus/rail stations; air/sea ports, etc., while the network arcs will be road/rail route
	segments or air corridors/sea lanes as appropriate.
	Data will be supplied (in formats as described below) for the nodes and arcs representing a transport
	network, together with a ‘command’ file specifying operations to be performed on the network data. These
	operations may include, for example, reporting the distance between two nodes (places) on the network;
	finding neighbour nodes to a starting point; finding or validating a node sequence to form a journey
	between two places (pairs of nodes for origin and destination). For each command type, a specific output
	format will be defined. To streamline the assessment process, your software must implement all input and
	output formats precisely.
	You will construct software in C++ with suitable class definitions for the necessary data structures, to input
	the supplied data and work through the commands. You will also be expected to present diagnostic data
	on process efficiency, for example the number of node/arc records visited in the data structure.
